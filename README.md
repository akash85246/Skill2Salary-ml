<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://skill2salary.streamlit.app/)

Skill2Salary is a smart salary prediction platform designed to help users estimate their expected salary based on educational background, work experience, and job preferences. Powered by machine learning, the app uses real-world data to make informed predictions and guide users in career planning.

### Features

- **Salary Prediction Engine**: Predicts salaries based on user input such as education, experience, job level, and location.
- **Advanced Ensemble Models**: Utilizes ensemble techniques like Stacking, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting for robust predictions.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Implements both GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV to optimize model performance.
- **Streamlit-Based UI**: Clean and interactive user interface built entirely with Streamlit for real-time predictions.
- **Categorical Feature Encoding**: Uses `OrdinalEncoder` with controlled category ordering and handles unknown categories gracefully.
- **Feature Engineering**: Includes derived metrics like experience buckets, combined experience score, and average academic score for improved accuracy.
- **Log-Salary Handling**: Trained on log-transformed salary data to handle skewed distributions, with inverse transformation for final output.
- **Responsive Input Forms**: Organizes user inputs into logical sections (education, job, company) for a better user experience.
- **Lightweight and Fast**: No authentication, no database‚Äîruns purely as a lightweight local or cloud-hosted app.
- **Deployment Ready**: Easily deployable on platforms like Render, HuggingFace Spaces, or Streamlit Cloud.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Get started quickly with these easy setup instructions.

### üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed and configured:

- **Python 3.8+**: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **pip**: Comes pre-installed with Python. Used to install Python packages.
- **Streamlit**: Install using `pip install streamlit` ([Streamlit Docs](https://docs.streamlit.io/))
- **Scikit-learn**: Install using `pip install scikit-learn`
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Install using `pip install pandas numpy`
- **Matplotlib or Seaborn** *(optional)*: For data visualization  
  `pip install matplotlib seaborn`
- **Git**: [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/) to clone the repository or manage version control
- **Jupyter Notebook** *(optional)*: For experimentation before deployment  
  `pip install notebook`

#### Recommended Knowledge

To make the most out of this project, it helps to be familiar with:

- **Machine Learning Concepts**
- **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**
- **Python & Pandas**
- **Model Evaluation & Hyperparameter Tuning**

### üöÄ Installation

Follow these steps to set up the **Skill2Salary** project locally:

---

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akash85246/Skill2Salary-ml.git
cd Skill2Salary-ml
```

---

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment** (Optional but recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

---

3. **Install Python Dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> If you don‚Äôt have a `requirements.txt`, install manually:

```bash
pip install streamlit pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

---

4. **Ensure Model Artifacts are Present**

Make sure the following files are inside the `model/` directory:

- `model.pkl` ‚Äì Trained ensemble model
- `oe.pkl` ‚Äì OrdinalEncoder used during training
- `selector.pkl` ‚Äì Feature selector (e.g., SelectKBest)
- `columns.pkl` ‚Äì List of columns used during training

> These files are required for prediction and must match the training pipeline.

---

5. **Run the Streamlit App**

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

---

6. **(Optional)**: Explore the Jupyter Notebooks for Training & Tuning

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

You can explore training workflows like feature selection, model tuning (GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV), and ensemble building.

---

üìå **Note**: This project doesn't require any database or authentication setup. It's a lightweight, ML-powered web app built purely with **Streamlit** for UI and **scikit-learn** for prediction.

<!-- USAGE -->
## üìà Usage

Using the **Skill2Salary** application is simple and intuitive. Here's how to get started:

---

### üéØ Predicting Your Salary

1. **Launch the App**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. **Fill in Your Details**  
   Provide your:
   - Education level  
   - 10th and 12th grade marks  
   - College CGPA  
   - Work experience in years  
   - Job seniority level  
   - Company size and location  
   - Year you started working  

3. **Click on the "üîç Predict Salary" Button**  
   The model processes your input and returns a salary estimate based on advanced ensemble regression models.

---
<!-- Behind the Scenes -->
##  Behind the Scenes

- The app uses a **Stacked Ensemble Regressor** trained on industry-level salary datasets.
- Features are processed using:
  - `OrdinalEncoder` with predefined categories.
  - `SelectKBest` for feature selection.
- **Log-transformed salaries** are predicted and converted back using `np.expm1()` for more accurate skewed distribution modeling.

---
<!-- Tips for Better Predictions -->
## Tips for Better Predictions

- Use real or realistic inputs to get meaningful results.
- The model was trained with robust hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV).
- Try different combinations of job roles and experience levels to understand how they affect salary.
